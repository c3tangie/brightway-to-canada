# Brightway to Canada Consulting Web Source
Active development branch of the official website of Brightway to Canada Consulting Inc.

**Framework constructed by `ReactJS` + `Tailwind CSS v3.4.17`**

## Technologies
- `Javascript`
- `React`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `HTML`
- `Vite`

## Features
- Data-Driven Architecture
  Core content (services, Q&A, team profiles) is centralized in structured data files and rendered dynamically, enabling scalable updates without modifying page logic.

- Client-Side Routing & URL State Management
  Uses React Router with query parameters to deep-link specific service questions and preserve navigation state across reloads and shares.

- Custom Site-Wide Search Engine
  Implements a lightweight search system that auto-indexes services, questions, pages, and team data, ranks results by relevance, highlights matches, and paginates results — all without external dependencies.

- Reusable Component System
  Modular components (Navbar, Footer, banners, cards, detail layouts) are shared across pages to ensure consistency, maintainability, and low coupling.

- Performance-Focused SPA Setup
  Built with Vite for fast builds and optimized bundles, combined with lazy image loading and controlled re-renders for smooth user experience.

- Form Handling & Validation Logic
  Multi-section consultation and contact forms with client-side validation, confirmation prompts, and secure submission via Web3Forms API.

- UX & State Effects Management
  Explicit scroll restoration, controlled animations, and WIP fallbacks ensure predictable behavior across route transitions.
